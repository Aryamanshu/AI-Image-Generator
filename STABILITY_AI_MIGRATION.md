# Migration from DeepAI to Stability AI

This document explains the changes made to migrate the image generation API from DeepAI to Stability AI.

## Changes Made

1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Created a new `stabilityRoutes.js` file that uses the Stability AI API
   - Updated the server's `index.js` to use the new routes
   - Added Stability AI API key configuration in the `.env` file
   - Created a test script (`test-stability.js`) to verify the API key works

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Updated the API endpoint in `CreatePost.jsx` from `/api/v1/dalle` to `/api/v1/stability`
   - Redesigned the UI to match Stability AI branding
   - Improved the image container with modern design elements
   - Updated the card component with a more modern layout
   - Completely redesigned the Home page with Stability AI branding

## Setup Instructions

1. **Get a Stability AI API Key**:
   - Sign up at https://platform.stability.ai/
   - Navigate to https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys to create an API key
   - Add the API key to your `.env` file: `STABILITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

2. **Test the API**:
   - Run `node test-stability.js` to verify your API key works
   - If successful, it will save an image to `test-image.png`

3. **Start the Application**:
   - Start the server: `cd server && npm run start`
   - Start the client: `cd client && npm run dev`
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## API Response Format

The Stability AI API returns images in base64 format, which is different from the DeepAI API that returned image URLs. The response format has been standardized to work with the existing frontend code.

## UI Improvements

1. **Modern Card Design**:
   - Added loading skeletons
   - Improved image display with hover effects
   - Better content organization
   - Interactive elements for better user experience

2. **Enhanced Image Container**:
   - Gradient background and subtle shadows
   - Improved loading animation
   - Better empty state
   - Stability AI branding

3. **Redesigned Home Page**:
   - Hero section with Stability AI branding
   - Improved search functionality
   - Better gallery layout
   - Modern footer with links to Stability AI resources

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
2. Verify that the server is running on port 8080
3. Make sure you have sufficient credits in your Stability AI account
4. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
